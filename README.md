# PlayerJoinMessage
A small plugin for Bukkit/Spigot to change player join/leave messages.

- BukkitDev: https://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/messagejoinplayer/

It was more of a Maven learning course for me than a real project. Posting this source code, because its sitting on my hard drive doing nothing, that way it may be useful for someone.

Feel free to download, use and modify. "Do What You Want" license.
